## Production Skill Simulator

This is great for skills such as smithing, fletching, crafting, etc.. that have chance to preserve recipe resources and chance to double number of produced items.

* The first field - Number of crafts - should be calculated by the user by looking at what input material they will run out of first, and finding:
    (your current amount / amount required for 1 craft)

* Fields marked (optional) can be left blank and the related calculations will not be performed.

* Both % chance fields default to 0 if left blank.

* Base output defaults to 1 if left blank.

* Additional metrics can be included in the output by checking the boxes on the side of the tab.
